This site is being built on YouTube, one week at a time. See all the videos up to date here: [How to build a professional website from start to finish](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KQZUkRjfwMmTq_f1fbxerI)

Subscribe to [the channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners) to follow along as we develop this project step by step from the beginning.

## How to install/use

In order to get this super fantastic [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) powered template for Artists follow this simple step:

* If you haven't got ruby installed on your computer, install it.
* Then run in your terminal `$ gem install jekyll`
* Move/`cd` to a folder, always in your terminal, in which you want to insert the *Artists-Theme*
* Run `git clone https://github.com/DevTips/Artists-Theme.git`
* Then `cd Artists-Theme`
* `jekyll serve --watch`
* **DONE**

Isn't it fantastic?

This is a free Jekyll Theme that is currently being developed in weekly episodes on the [DevTips YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/devtipsfordesigners).

# [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.svg)](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/master/LICENSE)

Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

See what's new in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

Interested in testing out a [**pre-release "gemified" version**](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/feature/theme-gem) of the theme? Read this blog post to [learn now](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/jekyll/gemified-theme-alpha/).

[![Minimal Mistakes live preview][2]][1]

The theme includes responsive layouts (`single`, `archive`, and `splash` pages) that look great on mobile and desktop browsers.

## Contributing

Having trouble working with the theme? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

Minimal Mistakes has been designed as a base for you to customize and fit your site's unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it's not something that most people will use, I probably won't consider it. When in doubt ask. 

This goes for author sidebar links and "share button" additions -- I have no intention of merging in every possibly option, the essentials are there to get you started :smile:.

### Pull Requests

To help me out try to avoid creating pull requests on `master` and instead branch off of `develop`. It's much easier for me to test, merge, and roll them into new releases this way.
